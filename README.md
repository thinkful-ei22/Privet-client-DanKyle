## Privet!

### Brief Description
**Privet** uses a *Spaced Repetition* algorithm to speed up your learning.

Spaced repetition is a method for efficient learning that has you practice concepts or skills over increasing periods of time. It's based on the notion of a "forgetting curve," or the idea that over time, if we don't actively use or reflect on something we know, our knowledge decays.

With **Privet**, we help you stay ahead of that moment of forgetting, and we do it *efficiently*.

As you answer words correctly, we'll show you those words less frequently. If you guess the wrong answer, we'll give you more opportunities to practice that word. *Learning has never been easier!*

### Tech Stack
The app uses React and CSS grid for the frontend, Passport/JWT for authentication and Redux for state management.
